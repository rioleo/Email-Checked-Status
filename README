Email check status
=============

Finally! A way to absolve yourself from the responsibilities of being held accountable to your email!

The email unread count is fed directly through IMAP.

You'll need to modify your username and password, as well as modify the config file to reflect your database connections. The included SQL file should do the trick nicely as well.

You can do a variety of tricks to make life easier for you when you do check your email (the way I've included it is to simply visit checked.php). You can create a bookmarklet or make the process a lot more secure.
